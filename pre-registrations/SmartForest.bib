	abstract = {This study presents surface fuel (fine surface fuels and duff) moisture contents changes in normally stocked pine stands under varying weather conditions. The statistical models were developed to predict fuel moisture contents by using relations between dead surface fuel moisture contents and weather parameters. To determine the changes in fuel moisture contents more accurately, samples were taken from several regions having different weather conditions. The results of regression analyses have shown that temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, days since rain and wind speed had a significant effect on the moisture contents of fine surface fuels, and that temperature and wind speed were effective on duff moisture contents. Utilizing the models developed in this study, fine surface fuels and duff moisture contents could be predicted easily for large forested areas. The results obtained constitute the very basic and fundamental first steps towards establishing fire weather index and fire behavior prediction systems.},

	abstract = {Forest fire modeling often requires estimates of fuel moisture status. Among the various fuel variables used for fire modeling studies, the 10-h fuel moisture content (10-h FMC) is a promising predictor since it can be automatically measured in real time at study sites, yielding more information for fire models. Here, the performance of 10-h FMC models based on three different approaches, including regression (MREG), machine learning algorithms (MML) with random forest and support vector machine, and a process-based model (MFSMM), were compared. In addition, whole-year models of each type were compared with their respective seasonal models to explore whether the development of separate seasonal models yielded better estimates. Meteorological conditions and 10-h FMC were measured each minute for 18 months in and near a forest site and used for constructing and examining the 10-h FMC models. In the assessments, MML showed the best performance (R2 = 0.77–0.82 and root mean squared error [RMSE] = 2.05–2.84\%). The introduction of the correction coefficient into MREG improved its estimates (R2 improved from 0.56–0.58 to 0.68–0.70 and RMSE improved from 3.13–3.85\% to 2.64–3.27\%) by reducing the errors associated with high 10-h FMC values. MFSMM showed the worst performance (R2 = 0.41–0.43 and RMSE = 3.70–4.39\%), which could possibly be attributed to the lack of radiation input from the study sites as well as the particular fuel moisture stick sensor that was used. Whole-year models and seasonal models showed almost equal performance because 10-h FMC varied in response to atmospheric moisture conditions rather than specific seasonal patterns. The adoption of a hybrid modeling approach that blends machine-learning and process-based approaches may yield better predictability and interpretability. This study provides additional evidence of the lagged response of 10-h FMC after rainfall, and suggests a new way of accounting for this response in a regression model. Our approach using comparisons among models can be utilized for other fire modeling studies, including those involving fire danger ratings.},

	abstract = {Background
Forest fire risk predictions are based on the most conservation daily predictions, and the lowest litter moisture content of each day is often used to predict the day’s fire risk. Yunnan Province is the area with the most frequent and serious forest fires in China, but there is almost no research on the dynamic changes and model predictions of the litter moisture content in this area. Therefore, to reduce the occurrence of forest fires and improve the accuracy of forest fire risk predictions, it is necessary to understand these dynamic changes and establish an appropriate prediction model for the typical litter moisture content in Yunnan Province.

Method
During the fire prevention period, daily dynamic changes in the litter moisture content are obtained by monitoring the daily step size, and the relationships between the litter moisture content and meteorological elements are analyzed. In this study, the meteorological element regression method, moisture code method and direction estimation method are selected to establish litter moisture content prediction models, and the applicability of each model is analyzed.

Results
We found that dynamic changes in the litter moisture content have obvious lags compared with meteorological elements, and the litter moisture content is mainly related to the air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. With an increase in the sampling interval of meteorological elements, the significances of these correlations first increase and then decrease. The moisture content value obtained by directly using the moisture code method in the Fire Weather Index (FWI) significantly different from the measured value, so this method is not applicable. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) values obtained with the meteorological element regression method are 2.97\% and 14.06\%, those from the moisture code method are 3.27\% and 14.07\%, and those from the direct estimation method are 2.82\% and 12.76\%, respectively.

Conclusions
The direct estimation method has the lowest error and the strongest extrapolation ability; this method can meet the needs of daily fire forecasting. Therefore, it is feasible to use the direct estimation method to predict litter moisture contents in Yunnan Province.},
