# Smart Forest Draft Data

These files are preliminary data extracted from the project's postgres database in June of 2022. The eventual analysis may use data directly from the database or CSV "snapshots." 

Column headers were added and timestamp was revised to number of epoch seconds after experiencing too many challenges importing the original timestamp format into R.

dev_site_info.csv - Site ID, Site name, longitude, lattitude, elevation.

dev_weather_data0.csv- Preliminary weather data for a single station, used for developing databases.
