	abstract = {We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64\% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42\% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51\% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Unreliable research programmes waste funds, time, and even the lives of the organisms we seek to help and understand. Reducing this waste and increasing the value of scientific evidence require changing the actions of both individual researchers and the institutions they depend on for employment and promotion. While ecologists and evolutionary biologists have somewhat improved research transparency over the past decade (e.g. more data sharing), major obstacles remain. In this commentary, we lift our gaze to the horizon to imagine how researchers and institutions can clear the path towards more credible and effective research programmes.},

	abstract = {Savanna woody species evolved with fire. However, the effect of changes in the fire regimes, which tend to increase in the next decades, is not yet fully understood. Here, we tested the effects of increased fire frequency on species richness and the composition of woody plant communities. Specifically, we tested if a high frequency fire management reduces local species richness of communities and homogenizes species composition. We sampled woody plants in 40 sites, distributed in 20 pairs, in Emas National Park (Brazil). Each pair included sites with high fire frequency (firebreaks that are burned annually since 1994) and with natural fire frequency (occurring every 3–5 years). We used a paired t-test to assess effects of the two fire frequency treatments on species richness and permutation tests to compare distance decay in similarity composition and relative abundances. We found that sites with high fire frequency had lower species richness compared to their paired sites subjected to natural fire frequency. However, similarities in species composition among sites with high fire frequency were only slightly higher than among sites subjected to natural fire frequency. The rate of distance decay in similarity was similar on the two treatments. At local scales, the high frequency of fire reduced species richness, an impact that in the long run may be irreversible. However, at broader spatial scales, effects were small as two treatments included similar sets of species. Prescribed fires have the potential to modify the natural dynamics of the woody communities in the savannas we studied. In our study, fire appears to act as a hierarchical filter, selecting species at broader spatial scales and nesting communities at local scales.},

	abstract = {Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology are increasingly dependent on computational code to conduct research, and the use of efficient methods to share, reproduce, and collaborate on code as well as any research-related documentation has become fundamental. GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and other materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses, and protocols.
Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub by EEB researchers is not widespread due to the lack of domain-specific information and guidelines. To help EEB researchers adopt useful features from GitHub in their own workflows, we review twelve practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty: storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, and writing a manuscript. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.},
